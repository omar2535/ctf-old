Things I learned:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ls -al *        	                                                : Lists all files and their sizes in sub directories
cat			                                                        : Reads out the file data
find / -size XXc	                                                : Finds files of XX bytes
2> /dev/null                                                        : Discards all error logs from command into ""/dev/null"
grep "<text to find here>" filename.txt                             : Finds the line of text wanted inside filename.txt
sort data.txt| uniq -u                                              : Sorts the data first then finds the unique string(NOTE: uniq does not work on unsorted data)
ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -l <username> -p <port number>      : SSH's into the bandit server with login username -l and portnumber -l
strings <filename>                                                  : Finds the readable strings inside the file and displays them
base64 -d <filename>                                                : Decodes the base64 encoded file and prints it out
cat data.txt | tr '[a-z]' '[n-za-m]'                                : Reads out cat after mapping [a-z] characters into starting from [nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm] (also called a ROT13 encoding). Replaces letters at each one with another one when met, eg. A -> N, B -> O ect. 
>                                                                   : Makes a new file placing contents of previous command into the new file. Ex: (xxd -data.txt >data1.txt)
mv                                                                  : Moves the file to a new filename
tar                                                                 : will make the file into compressed file
file                                                                : tells you type of file (eg. compressed)
gunzip/bunzip2                                                      : unzips the respective .gz or .bz2 files
vim <filename>                                                      : allows you to edit files inside terminal
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost                            : allows you to ssh with a private key using bandi14 username at localhost(in this case it was already banditlabs)
nc <host> <port number>                                             : allows you to read/write data accross network connections (eg. a ssh key)
